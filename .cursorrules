# Cursor Rules for tg-note project

## 🚨 CRITICAL: ALWAYS READ AGENTS.MD FIRST

Before doing ANY work in this project, you MUST:

1. **READ `/workspace/AGENTS.md` COMPLETELY**
   - This is NOT optional
   - This is NOT a suggestion
   - This is MANDATORY

2. **FOLLOW ALL INSTRUCTIONS IN AGENTS.MD**
   - Install dependencies if missing (pre-commit, black, isort, pytest)
   - Use proper code formatting
   - Update tests
   - Update documentation
   - Run pre-commit before any git commit

3. **NEVER SAY "tool is not available"**
   - If pre-commit is missing → INSTALL IT: `pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install`
   - If pytest is missing → INSTALL IT: `pip install pytest pytest-asyncio`
   - If black is missing → INSTALL IT: `pip install black isort`
   - Add `/home/ubuntu/.local/bin` to PATH: `export PATH="/home/ubuntu/.local/bin:$PATH"`

## Quick Pre-Commit Command

```bash
export PATH="/home/ubuntu/.local/bin:$PATH" && pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Project Standards

- **Formatting**: Black with line-length=100
- **Import sorting**: isort with --profile=black
- **Comments**: Use AICODE-NOTE, AICODE-TODO, AICODE-ASK
- **Testing**: Always update/add tests for code changes
- **Documentation**: Update docs_site/ after new features
- **Pre-commit**: ALWAYS run before committing - NO EXCEPTIONS

## Forbidden Actions

- ❌ Commit without running pre-commit
- ❌ Create .md or .txt summary files in repo root
- ❌ Ignore Black formatting
- ❌ Skip tests updates
- ❌ Claim tools are unavailable without trying to install them

## What This Means

If the user says "you ignored AGENTS.md":
- You did not read it at the start
- You did not follow the instructions
- You need to apologize and actually follow the workflow

If the user says "you didn't run pre-commit":
- You claimed it wasn't available
- You should have installed it
- Install it now and run it

## Bottom Line

**AGENTS.md is the source of truth. This .cursorrules file just reminds you to read it.**

**Go read AGENTS.md now if you haven't already! →** `/workspace/AGENTS.md`
