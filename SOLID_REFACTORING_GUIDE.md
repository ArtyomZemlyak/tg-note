# SOLID Refactoring Guide

## Overview

This document explains the refactoring performed to improve code structure and adherence to SOLID principles.

## SOLID Principles Applied

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**Before:** `BotHandlers` class had multiple responsibilities:
- Managing user contexts (aggregators, agents, modes)
- Processing messages
- Creating notes
- Answering questions
- Managing Git operations
- Tracking processed messages

**After:** Responsibilities split into focused services:

#### `UserContextManager` (`src/services/user_context_manager.py`)
- **Single Responsibility:** Manage user-specific contexts
- Creates and caches user message aggregators
- Creates and caches user agents
- Manages user modes (note/ask)
- Invalidates caches when settings change

#### `NoteCreationService` (`src/services/note_creation_service.py`)
- **Single Responsibility:** Create notes in knowledge base
- Parses message content
- Processes content with agent
- Saves to knowledge base
- Handles Git operations
- Tracks processed messages

#### `QuestionAnsweringService` (`src/services/question_answering_service.py`)
- **Single Responsibility:** Answer questions about knowledge base
- Parses questions from messages
- Queries knowledge base using agent
- Returns answers to users

#### `MessageProcessor` (`src/services/message_processor.py`)
- **Single Responsibility:** Process and route messages
- Converts messages to dict format
- Adds messages to aggregators
- Routes message groups to appropriate services

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

**Before:** `AgentFactory` used if-elif chains to create agents:
```python
if agent_type in ["autonomous", "qwen_code", "openai"]:
    return cls._create_autonomous_agent(config, agent_type)
elif agent_type == "qwen_code_cli":
    return cls._create_qwen_cli_agent(config)
```

**After:** Registry pattern (`src/agents/agent_registry.py`):
- **Open for extension:** New agent types can be registered without modifying existing code
- **Closed for modification:** Adding new agents doesn't require changing the factory

```python
# Register new agent types easily
registry.register("my_new_agent", factory=my_agent_factory)

# Or
registry.register("simple_agent", agent_class=SimpleAgent)
```

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

**Applied:** All agents implement `BaseAgent` interface and are interchangeable:
```python
class BaseAgent(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def process(self, content: Dict) -> Dict:
        pass
```

Any agent can be substituted without breaking functionality.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

**Applied:** Created focused interfaces for services (`src/services/interfaces.py`):

```python
class IUserContextManager(ABC):
    # Only methods related to user context management
    
class IMessageProcessor(ABC):
    # Only methods related to message processing
    
class INoteCreationService(ABC):
    # Only methods related to note creation
    
class IQuestionAnsweringService(ABC):
    # Only methods related to question answering
```

Clients only depend on interfaces they actually use.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**Before:** Classes directly instantiated their dependencies:
```python
self.content_parser = ContentParser()  # Direct instantiation
self.settings_manager = SettingsManager(settings)  # Tight coupling
```

**After:** Dependencies injected through constructor:
```python
def __init__(
    self,
    bot: AsyncTeleBot,
    user_context_manager: IUserContextManager,  # Depend on interface
    settings_manager: SettingsManager
):
    self.bot = bot
    self.user_context_manager = user_context_manager
    self.settings_manager = settings_manager
```

**Benefits:**
- Easy to test (can inject mocks)
- Easy to change implementations
- Loose coupling between components

## New Architecture

### Dependency Injection Container

`src/core/container.py` - Simple DI container for managing dependencies

```python
container = Container()
container.register("service_name", factory_function, singleton=True)
service = container.get("service_name")
```

### Service Container

`src/core/service_container.py` - Configures all services and their dependencies

```python
def configure_services(container: Container) -> None:
    container.register("tracker", lambda c: ProcessingTracker(...))
    container.register("user_context_manager", lambda c: UserContextManager(...))
    # ... etc
```

### Service Layer

All business logic moved to service classes:

```
src/services/
├── __init__.py
├── interfaces.py                    # Service interfaces
├── user_context_manager.py          # User context management
├── note_creation_service.py         # Note creation logic
├── question_answering_service.py    # Q&A logic
└── message_processor.py             # Message processing
```

### Updated Bot Handlers

`src/bot/handlers.py` - Simplified handlers that delegate to services:

**Before:** 830 lines with complex business logic
**After:** ~420 lines focused on Telegram integration

## Migration Path

### Using the New Architecture

1. **Import the service container:**
```python
from src.core.service_container import create_service_container
```

2. **Create and configure container:**
```python
container = create_service_container()
```

3. **Get services:**
```python
telegram_bot = container.get("telegram_bot")
```

### Migration Approach

The refactoring was done in place:
- The old `BotHandlers` class in `src/bot/handlers.py` was completely refactored
- The refactored version now uses dependency injection and delegates to services
- All business logic was extracted to service classes

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. Testability
- Services can be tested in isolation
- Easy to inject mocks/stubs
- No need to instantiate entire system for unit tests

### 2. Maintainability
- Each service has clear, focused responsibility
- Changes to one service don't affect others
- Easier to understand and modify code

### 3. Extensibility
- New services can be added without modifying existing code
- New agent types can be registered without changing factory
- New features can be implemented as new services

### 4. Reusability
- Services can be reused in different contexts
- Clear interfaces make integration easier
- No tight coupling to specific implementations

### 5. Flexibility
- Easy to swap implementations
- Can configure different service combinations
- Supports different deployment scenarios

## Example: Adding a New Agent Type

```python
# 1. Create your agent class
class MyCustomAgent(BaseAgent):
    async def process(self, content: Dict) -> Dict:
        # Your implementation
        pass

# 2. Create a factory function
def create_my_agent(config: Dict) -> MyCustomAgent:
    return MyCustomAgent(config=config)

# 3. Register it
from src.agents.agent_registry import register_agent
register_agent("my_custom", factory=create_my_agent)

# 4. Use it
from src.agents.agent_factory import AgentFactory
agent = AgentFactory.create_agent("my_custom", config={})
```

No need to modify existing code!

## Example: Adding a New Service

```python
# 1. Define interface (optional but recommended)
class IMyService(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def do_something(self) -> None:
        pass

# 2. Implement service
class MyService(IMyService):
    def __init__(self, dependency: SomeDependency):
        self.dependency = dependency
    
    async def do_something(self) -> None:
        # Implementation
        pass

# 3. Register in service container
def configure_services(container: Container):
    # ... existing services ...
    
    container.register(
        "my_service",
        lambda c: MyService(dependency=c.get("some_dependency")),
        singleton=True
    )

# 4. Use it
my_service = container.get("my_service")
await my_service.do_something()
```

## Testing Examples

### Testing a Service with Mocked Dependencies

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, AsyncMock
from src.services.note_creation_service import NoteCreationService

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_note_creation():
    # Create mocks
    mock_bot = AsyncMock()
    mock_tracker = Mock()
    mock_repo_manager = Mock()
    mock_user_context = Mock()
    mock_settings = Mock()
    
    # Inject mocks
    service = NoteCreationService(
        bot=mock_bot,
        tracker=mock_tracker,
        repo_manager=mock_repo_manager,
        user_context_manager=mock_user_context,
        settings_manager=mock_settings
    )
    
    # Test
    await service.create_note(...)
    
    # Verify
    assert mock_bot.edit_message_text.called
```

## Conclusion

This refactoring significantly improves the codebase by:

1. **Following SOLID principles** - Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **Improving testability** - Dependencies can be easily mocked
3. **Enhancing maintainability** - Clear separation of concerns
4. **Enabling extensibility** - New features can be added without modifying existing code
5. **Providing flexibility** - Services and implementations can be easily swapped

The architecture is now more professional, scalable, and maintainable.
