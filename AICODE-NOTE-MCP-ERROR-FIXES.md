# AICODE-NOTE: MCP Error Fixes

## Issues Identified

### 1. **MCP Hub Server - ClosedResourceError**
- **Symptom**: `anyio.ClosedResourceError` when sending responses via SSE
- **Root Cause**: SSE connection closed prematurely, violating FastMCP protocol
- **Impact**: Server crashes when trying to send responses to closed connections

### 2. **Bot Server - CancelledError**
- **Symptom**: `asyncio.exceptions.CancelledError` during vector search operations
- **Root Cause**: Long-running vector search operations exceeding timeout (600s)
- **Impact**: Vector search operations fail, bot initialization fails

### 3. **Vector Search Performance Issues**
- **Symptom**: Embedding 351 chunks taking 13+ seconds, causing timeouts
- **Root Cause**: Large document sets processed in single batch
- **Impact**: Timeout errors, failed indexing operations

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Improved SSE Connection Management**
- Added automatic reconnection when SSE connection fails
- Better error handling for closed connections
- Heartbeat monitoring for connection health

### 2. **Batch Processing for Vector Search**
- Added `VECTOR_SEARCH_BATCH_SIZE` configuration (default: 50 documents)
- Process large document sets in smaller batches
- Prevents timeout issues with large knowledge bases

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling and Retry Logic**
- Added retry mechanism for MCP operations (3 attempts with 5s delay)
- Better timeout handling with specific error messages
- Graceful degradation when operations fail

### 4. **Improved Logging and Monitoring**
- Added timing information for embedding operations
- Better progress tracking for batch operations
- More detailed error messages for debugging

### 5. **Configuration Updates**
- Added `VECTOR_SEARCH_BATCH_SIZE` setting
- Updated configuration examples
- Better documentation for timeout settings

## Configuration Changes

### New Settings
```yaml
# Batch size for vector search operations
VECTOR_SEARCH_BATCH_SIZE: 50  # documents per batch
```

### Existing Settings
```yaml
# Timeout for MCP requests
MCP_TIMEOUT: 600  # seconds (10 minutes)
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with Large Knowledge Bases**
   - Use 100+ documents to test batch processing
   - Verify no timeout errors occur

2. **Test Connection Recovery**
   - Simulate network interruptions
   - Verify automatic reconnection works

3. **Test Error Handling**
   - Verify retry logic works for failed operations
   - Check graceful degradation

## Impact

- **Reliability**: Reduced timeout errors and connection issues
- **Performance**: Better handling of large document sets
- **Maintainability**: Improved error messages and logging
- **Scalability**: Batch processing allows larger knowledge bases
